# Glyphsapp-Plugins
Plugins for Glyphsapp by [Mark Frömberg](http://www.markfromberg.com/) aka @DeutschMark

#### Siblings
Superimposes shape groups for the current glyph as a drawing reference.

#### Distance And Angle
Shows the direct distance of two selected Elements (Nodes, Anchors, Components) and their angle.

#### Kerning Group Reference
Live preview of the kerning group reference glyph next to the current one.

#### Rotated
Displays the current letter as a 180° rotated version of itself. Symmetry helper.

#### Node Count
A little number in the edit view which keeps track of the current glyphs’s count of nodes.

### How to use

Download or clone this whole `Glyphsapp-Plugins` repo (it is filled up with more plugins every now and then) and copy the `*.glyphsReporter` file(s) into your Glyphsapp Plugins folder (eg. `/Library/Application\ Support/Glyphs/Plugins`), or double click the plugin and confirm the dialogue in Glyphsapp. In any case you need to restart Glyphs with each update of your plugins. Select them from the View menu, they are called something like `Show Siblings`. If you want to set shortcuts, do so in the OSX settings by calling them by their exact name.
