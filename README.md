# Glyphsapp-Plugins
Plugins for Glyphsapp by [Mark Frömberg](http://www.markfromberg.com/) aka @DeutschMark. Detailed information inside the readme of each plugin.

Due to maintenance reasons I have moved the Plugins to a single Repository for each one. Please find the new locations below here in the readme. I will keep the old Plugins here for some days but they are considered to be outdated now.

### How to use

Download or clone this whole `Glyphsapp-Plugins` repo (it is filled up with more plugins every now and then) and copy the `*.glyphsReporter` file(s) into your Glyphsapp Plugins folder (eg. `/Library/Application\ Support/Glyphs/Plugins`), or double click the plugin and confirm the dialogue in Glyphsapp. In any case you need to restart Glyphs with each update of your plugins. Select them from the View menu, they are called something like `Show Siblings`. If you want to set shortcuts, do so in the OSX settings by calling them by their exact name.
