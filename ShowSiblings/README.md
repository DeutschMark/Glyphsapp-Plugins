# Show Siblings

## Plugin for Glyphsapp

This is a Plugin for the [Glyphs font editor](http://glyphsapp.com/). It displays a group of predefined glyphs in the background of your letters. This can be both pretty helpful in the beginning of a design as well as at intermediate progress where quick proof overview is needed. The degree of a desired match depends on each design, of course.

### Default groups

The default groups are as follows and can be customized in the `Contents/Resources/ShowSiblings.py`, search for the *defaultSiblings* dictionary.

k x
